# AI Algorithm Taxonomy for Human-Systems Integration (HSI)

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a structured taxonomy of AI algorithms tailored for Human-Systems Integration (HSI) projects. The primary objective is to create a comprehensive guide for selecting the most suitable algorithms based on various dimensions such as human interaction, algorithm function, data type, and computational needs. By organizing AI algorithms in this way, we seek to improve the transparency, trustworthiness, and explainability (XAI) of these systems, addressing the critical need for algorithm selection beyond developer intuition.

## Problem Description
Currently, there is no structured framework or taxonomy to assist developers and decision-makers in selecting the appropriate AI algorithms for HSI projects. As a result, algorithm selection is often based on the developer's prior knowledge or ad-hoc choices, which can lead to inconsistencies in performance and difficulty in explaining AI outputs. Explainable AI (XAI) is crucial for building trust in AI systems, but inconsistent usage of algorithms further complicates this process.

Our project aims to bridge this gap by developing a taxonomy (or other structure) that helps identify the most suitable algorithms for specific tasks within HSI projects.

## Project Goals
The project focuses on achieving the following objectives:
1. **Develop a taxonomy (or other structure) of AI algorithms** for HSI projects.
2. **Determine the role of human involvement (Human-in-the-Loop)** in the AI process and its necessity for XAI.
3. **Identify if varying levels of explanation** are required to build trust based on:
   - Occupation
   - Industry

## Multidimensional Algorithm Structure (MAS)
The taxonomy will be structured using the **Multidimensional Algorithm Structure (MAS)** concept, which involves six spheres (dimensions) that categorize and define the algorithm's interaction with humans, data, and infrastructure.

## Data Sources
The following datasets will be used to develop and evaluate the taxonomy:
1. **O*NET Online Career Data** ([https://www.onetonline.org](https://www.onetonline.org))
2. **NAICS (North American Industry Classification System)** ([https://www.census.gov/naics/](https://www.census.gov/naics/))
3. **OpenML AI Algorithms Database** ([https://www.openml.org](https://www.openml.org))
